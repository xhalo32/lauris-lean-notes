# Foundations

We will consider Lean's type theory as a language for writing [formal proofs][formal-proof]. This language is highly expressive while consisting of only a few kinds of expressions.{margin}[For the moment, we omit expressions related to {ref "sec-quotient-types"}[quotient types], and effectively consider a [sublanguage][sublanguage].] Every type is either a universe in the universe hierarchy, a function type, or arises from the type constructor of an inductive type. The remaining expressions can be organized along two axes:

  <tbody>
    <tr><th>function</th><td><code class="math inline">\lambda</code>-abstraction</td><td>evaluation</td></tr>
    <tr><th>inductive type</th><td>constructor</td><td>recursor</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

We begin with an introduction to types and universes. Since our primary goal is to study formal proofs using Lean, the universe of propositions at the bottom of the universe hierarchy plays a central role. The remainder of the chapter then proceeds through functions and inductive types.

# Constructions

We have now seen all the primitive notions in Lean's type theory. To reiterate, they are universes, function types, and inductive types,{margin}[We view formation of function and inductive types as primitive notions. This does not include concrete function types or inductive types.] together with introduction and elimination of expressions of the latter two types. In addition, we have considered the concrete inductive types `Eq` and `Nat`, as well as the [product][product-type] and [sum][sum-type] types `Prod` and `Sum`.

We begin with an encoding of first-order logic using inductive types. This involves product and sum types similar to `Prod` and `Sum`, a [dependent sum type][dep-sum-type], a [unit type][unit-type], and an [empty type][empty-type].{margin}[These types are called `And`, `Or`, `Exists`, `True`, and `False`.] The remainder of the chapter then takes a deeper look at `Eq` and `Nat`.

# Relating types

Lean provides several mechanisms for relating types to one another:

* _Type classes_ let shared structure across types be organized into inheritance hierarchies.

* _Quotient types_ allow formation of a new type by identifying expressions of an existing type under an equivalence relation, together with canonical maps mediating between the two types.

* _Coercions_ let expressions of one type be used implicitly where another is expected, encoding embeddings between types, for instance.

# Axioms

Axioms are propositions postulated without proof. There are seven [standard][standard-axioms] axioms, three of which have mathematical content.{margin}[Three of the remaining axioms concern performance optimizations whose soundness rests on the compiler beyond the kernel. The final one is used by [sorry][sorry].] These three are the quotient axiom, propositional extensionality, and the [axiom of choice][axiom-of-choice]. The first two are similar in that they postulate equality assuming equivalence.
